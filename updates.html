<p class="GameTitle">New logo.</p>
<p class="Imagetext">The logo has been redesigned to match the new fox style.</p>

<div class="container">
<img src="updatesimages/skineditor.png" class="righty">
<p class="GameTitle">	
Skin editor.</p>
<p class="Imagetext">It's not beautiful, BUT it works. The coolest thing about it is that you can be the animal you want. Want to be a fox? Just paint yourself orange. Want to be a cat? Just be gray with pink ears. It's an early test, so there's no skin shop. Meanwhile, you will have 3 different eyes, 2 hats but 0 extra animals in your wardrobe.</p>

<div class="container">
<img src="updatesimages/physics.png" class="righty">
<p class="GameTitle">	
Revamped physics.</p>
<p class="Imagetext">Previously, physics were a buggy mess. And they still are! They've improved a bit, but you will still randomly teleport after being hit by something movable while you're above something movable, sorry! Also, foxes eyes change every time they get hit >_< </p>

<div class="container">
<img src="updatesimages/cubes.png" class="righty">
<p class="GameTitle">	
New levels.</p>
<p class="Imagetext">2 new levels will appear the next update.</p>

<div class="container">
<p class="GameTitle">	
+ Extra.</p>
<p>- Countdown, Qualified and Eliminated texts are now 3D</p>
<p>- Foxes are now actual furries</p>
<p>- Player speed has been increased from 420 to 690</p>
<p>- Jump height and gravity increased. This means that jump height is the same as before, but you'll fall faster.</p>
<p>- Ads. Don't worry, they're not intrusive... at all.</p>
<p>- Goodbye BETA stage. The game will remain in beta, at least inside, but this update I will set the game as "released" instead of "open alpha" in Google Play so people can give their lovely 3 stars reviews.</p>
<p>- Fixed the "if I idle on here, I won't get hit by the cubes" bug.</p>
<p>- Fixed the "when I change my name and then the color, my name disappears" bug.</p>
<p>- Fixed the "I can put 'enter' spaces in the name and have multiple lines" bug.</p>
<p>- Level 1 has new visual features.</p>
<p>- Fixed the "when I change my name and then the color, my name disappears" bug.</p>
<p>- Movable platforms won't become static when you stop looking at them.</p>
<p>- and more stuff I probably don't remember.</p>

<p>If you've got a suggestion, please email me in English or Spanish. I will for sure read you, even if I don't reply.</p>
