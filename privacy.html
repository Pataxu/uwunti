<br>
This website doesn't collect any data.

<br><br>
There are no cookies, no trackers, nothing.

<br><br>
I can't even know how many people visited this page.

<br><br>
This whole thing is just plain a HTML and CSS site to showcase my games.

<br><br>
But, this webpage contains links to external sites. Note that these sites are not operated by me.
<br>
 Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. 
<br>
I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
